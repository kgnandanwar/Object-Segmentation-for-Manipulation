# Object-Segmentation-for-Manipulation

Problem Statement:

Read a depth image with defined defines the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

Extend this code to:
1. Deproject the depth image to a point cloud.
2. Filter the objects on the table (remove the table from the point cloud).
3. Project the point cloud to a depth map from a top-down view, and save the depth map as an image.
